# Algorithms in Python

This projects contains documents and practical examples of fundamentals of algorithms. All of the examples are written in Python language.


## Steps to design an algorithm

### 1. Understand the problem
If you are going to design an algorithm, there is for sure a problem that you want to solve.
The first and the most important step will always be to understand the problem. If you jump into the next steps
before analyzing and understanding the problem you will end up with an algorithm that will require a lot changes
and will cause you a lot of trouble.

### 2. Analyze the requirements
In any algorithm you will need some formulas or some variables that are required to initialize the process.
You should analyze what do you need before designing the algorithm, and also you must be sure that you can get
everything that is required. Otherwise you will realize that you are missing some parts in the middle of the process,
and you may end up deleting your algorithm and starting from the beginning.

### 3. Find alternative algorithms
For every problem there can be several ways to achieve the same result. Our aim when designing would be to have the result
with least operations or with the fastest speed. Making your algorithms understandable for others is as much important
as it's speed. The fastest algorithm can be replaced by the one that is at least as fast as it is understandable.

### 4. Translate into code
After you are sure that the algorithm you designed is the best one, now it is time to code it.
The programming language is just a tool that we use to solve our problems. Be sure that you are choosing the right
tool for the job. After coding the algorithm and fixing all of the issues you may face you need to be sure that the code
is reflecting the algorithm without changing it.

### 5. Improve the code
In this last step you should verify that there is nothing unnecessary in your code. Here you can first of all analyze
the performance of your code. The performance can be good in time but it may have a high memory and CPU consumption.
At this step you need to find the right balance between these three factors.
